	<div class="wrapper-wide text">
		<p>At some point at the beginning of 2018, I wanted to create an app that focuses more on the visual disability. This idea came to me one day when  I accidentally broke my glass in the shopping mall and didn't want to drive back home. I thought of taking the bus but was afraid I would get on the wrong one because of my blurry vision, so I had to hail an uber instead. On the drive back, I thought to myself why I couldn't take the transit service and how to solve it?</p>
<p>So I did my research on the type of visual disabilities and how some apps are solving it. One that popped out to me was Slack; it has sidebar theme for Protanopia and Deuteranopia (Green & Red deficiency) and Tritanopia (Blue deficiency). Another interesting app that I came across was Be My Eyes- where anyone can help the visually impaired by commenting on the pictures posted by them.</p>
<h2>User Research</h2>
<p>Getting to unknown places in today's world has a unique set of challenges. If you are driving, you have to constantly
	 look at the maps, exit signs, lanes, traffic signals and speed limits. However, that's completely different with
	 a visual disability, one has to always depend on
 	someone to take them to different places, it is also hard to take the public transits if alone.</p>
<figure class="browser-screenshot"><img src="../content/1-work/2-perception/glaucoma-1.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>To design a valuable product, I did some contextual inquiry with a couple of people who had various impairments. Initially, I asked them a set of questions about their everyday lives. Then I went into some details like what was the recent problems they faced, any struggle in their lives and if so how do they deal with it? </p>

<h2>Affinity Diagram</h2>
<p>The people that I talk with had some specific problem that can be solved with a help of an app. But the apps in the app
	 store are targeting towards the general population and not for a specific set of user groups with a disability.
	  Here is the initial finding.</p>

<p>Wintr.mx is a single page site. It&#8217;s responsive; the track titles and artists are dynamically pulled from the .mp3 files; songs can be streamed directly on the webpage, downloaded as zipped album, or individually by right-clicking the track name; and the setup is easily extendable—adding a new year is as simple as uploading a folder of mp3s and a background image.</p>
<h2>Mixing music, from A to G</h2>
<p>In 2011, I had assembled all the tracks I liked, but listening to the album as a whole, the flow just wasn&#8217;t there. I shuffled and reshuffled, groping through the dark and hoping to latch onto a solution, when suddenly I was struck: <em>what if I used music theory to guide which track comes next?</em> I analyzed the starting and ending keys of each song, modulating in fifths, stepwise, or in parallel—the same techniques that composers use to gracefully transition from one section to the next. It worked beautifully.</p>
<figure><img src="../content/1-work/2-watchOS/wintrmx-moleskine.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>The music has evolved along with the design, each year becoming a little more diverse than the last: the most recent mix includes a Spanish celebration of <em title="the old year">el año viejo</em>, a Renaissance-era French carol, Swedish electrofolk, some j-pop wishing you a very merry Kurisumasu, and a gospel rock anthem.</p>
<h2>Greetings from here or there</h2>
<p>Each album cover features a vintage postcard photo of a place I visited during that year. It’s a fun easter egg for my close friends, and a yearly reminder of how fortunate I’ve been to visit these places.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p><a href="http://wintr.mx" target="_blank">Wintr.mx</a> has always been simply a way to spread music I enjoy to the people I love, and in that regard I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with its success: I&#8217;ve had friends who I haven&#8217;t seen since high school message me and say how much they love listening to the mix each December. Family members halfway across the globe telling me how glad they are for it. The tradition will keep going as long as I can continue to find fresh inspiration.</p>
